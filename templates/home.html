    <h3>Is Insider Trading Legal?</h3>
        <p> Insider trading involves using non-public information for stock trades. 
            It's illegal if it's based on material non-public information, but legal if company insiders report their trades to the SEC. 
            This publicly accessible information promotes market transparency. 
            Non-insiders can gain insights from these trades, assisting their investment decisions and promoting a fair marketplace.
